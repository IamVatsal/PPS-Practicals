# Programming for Problem Solving (PPS) Practicals

This repository contains my college practicals for the subject **Programming for Problem Solving (PPS)**.

## Structure

- Each folder is organized by practical number and topic.
- Source codes are written in C.
- Includes programs for:
  - Basic input/output
  - Control structures (if, switch, loops)
  - Functions and recursion
  - Arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
  - Strings and string operations
  - Structures, unions, and enums
  - Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
  - File handling

## Usage

- Open any `.c` file in your preferred C IDE or editor.
- Compile using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Run the executable to test the program.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a reference and record of my solutions for all PPS practical assignments during my college course.
